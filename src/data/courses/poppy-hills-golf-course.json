    "Poppy Hills rides the rolling elevation of the Del Monte Forest, bringing together breathtaking design and golf's greatest landscape. Originally opened in 1986, the course underwent an extensive $10 million renovation in 2013-2014 that transformed it into what Colin Montgomerie compared to 'a little bit of Pinehurst and a little bit of Pine Valley.' The renovation removed 60 acres of irrigated turf, eliminated all rough in favor of sandy waste areas and pine straw, and opened surprising ocean views of Monterey Bay through the towering pines."
