  "bodyText": "Poppy Hills rides the rolling elevation of the Del Monte Forest, bringing together breathtaking design and golf's greatest landscape. Originally opened in 1986, the course underwent an extensive $10 million renovation in 2013-2014 that transformed it into what Colin Montgomerie compared to 'a little bit of Pinehurst and a little bit of Pine Valley.' The renovation removed 60 acres of irrigated turf, eliminated all rough in favor of sandy waste areas and pine straw, and opened surprising ocean views of Monterey Bay through the towering pines.",
  "tips": [
    "Play the sandy waste areas as you would links-style \u2014 bump and run works beautifully",
    "The bentgrass greens are among the purest on the peninsula \u2014 trust your reads",
    "Wind picks up in the afternoon \u2014 morning tee times play calmer"

For GTHS groups adding a Monterey Peninsula extension, this is the most accessible championship course in Pebble Beach at a fraction of the cost of its famous neighbors.",
