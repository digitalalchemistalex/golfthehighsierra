  "description": "One of only seven courses ever co-designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and Jr., Winchester Country Club unfolds across 223 forested acres in the Sierra Nevada foothills above Sacramento. Perched at 1,800 feet \u2014 below the snow and above the fog \u2014 this private club offers panoramic views of both the Sierra peaks and the Sacramento Valley. The course plays through three distinct topographies: steep woodlands, rolling prairies, and dramatic granite outcroppings. Massive rock formations border fairways, streams and lakes wind through the layout, and towering pines frame every shot. Ranked #1 in Sacramento Valley and among California's top 15 by Golf Digest. The 35,000 sq ft European hunting lodge-style clubhouse won Golf Inc.'s Clubhouse of the Year 2005.",

    "Perched at 1,800 feet in the Sierra Nevada foothills just off Interstate 80 past Auburn, Winchester Country Club is the course your group should experience on the way into or out of Reno-Tahoe. This is one of only seven courses in the world co-designed by the legendary father-son team of Robert Trent Jones Sr. and Robert Trent Jones Jr., and it plays through three distinct landscapes: steep woodlands, rolling prairies, and dramatic granite outcroppings.",
    "The course encompasses 223 forested acres with streams, lakes, and natural rock formations woven into every hole. Five sets of tees ranging from 5,144 to 7,108 yards make the layout playable for groups of all skill levels, while three par threes stretching over 200 yards demand bold shot-making from the back tees. The 35,000-square-foot clubhouse, built in the style of a European hunting lodge, won Golf Inc.'s Clubhouse of the Year and houses fine dining, a pub, and the Jones Library \u2014 ideal for post-round gatherings."
