  "description": "One of only seven courses ever co-designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and Jr., Winchester Country Club unfolds across 223 forested acres in the Sierra Nevada foothills above Sacramento. Perched at 1,800 feet — below the snow and above the fog — this private club offers panoramic views of both the Sierra peaks and the Sacramento Valley. Massive granite outcroppings border the fairways, streams wind through the layout, and towering pines frame every shot. Ranked among California's top 25 courses by Golf Digest and winner of Golf Inc.'s Clubhouse of the Year.",

    {
      "question": "Can groups play Winchester on a Reno/Tahoe golf trip?",
      "answer": "Yes — Winchester is the ideal first or last stop for groups traveling I-80 between Sacramento and Reno-Tahoe. We coordinate tee times, logistics, and pairing with your full trip itinerary. Contact us for private club access and group rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Winchester different from the Reno-Tahoe courses?",
      "answer": "Winchester sits in the Sierra foothills at 1,800 feet — warmer and drier than the Tahoe courses, with longer playing seasons. The RTJ Sr. & Jr. co-design is one of only seven such collaborations ever, and the 35,000 sq ft European hunting lodge-style clubhouse won Golf Inc.'s Clubhouse of the Year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Winchester a private club? How do groups get access?",
      "answer": "Winchester is a private club, but Golf the High Sierra can arrange group access for visiting golf groups as part of a multi-course trip package. Call us at 888-584-8232 for availability and private club booking."

    "Perched at 1,800 feet in the Sierra Nevada foothills just off Interstate 80 past Auburn, Winchester Country Club is the course your group should experience on the way into or out of Reno-Tahoe. This is one of only seven courses in the world co-designed by the legendary father-son team of Robert Trent Jones Sr. and Robert Trent Jones Jr., and it plays through three distinct landscapes: steep woodlands, rolling prairies, and dramatic granite outcroppings.",
    "The course encompasses 223 forested acres with streams, lakes, and natural rock formations woven into every hole. Five sets of tees ranging from 5,144 to 7,108 yards make the layout playable for groups of all skill levels, while three par threes stretching over 200 yards demand bold shot-making from the back tees. The 35,000-square-foot clubhouse, built in the style of a European hunting lodge, won Golf Inc.'s Clubhouse of the Year and houses fine dining, a pub, and the Jones Library — ideal for post-round gatherings."

  "pointOfView": "Winchester is the hidden weapon in any Reno-Tahoe golf trip itinerary. Nestled in the Sierra foothills right off I-80, it's the perfect course to bookend your journey — a warm-up round on arrival or a grand finale before heading home. The RTJ Sr. & Jr. pedigree is unmistakable: dramatic elevation changes, granite boulders framing fairways, and greens that reward precision over power. The course plays through three completely different landscapes in 18 holes, keeping every member of your group engaged from the first tee to the lodge-style clubhouse. At 1,800 feet, you're below the Tahoe snow and above the Sacramento fog — the sweet spot for year-round golf conditions. The clubhouse alone is worth the trip: fine dining with views over the course, a cozy pub, and the Jones Library for private group dinners. Winchester turns a drive-through into a destination.",
