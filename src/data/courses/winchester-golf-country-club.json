  "description": "One of only seven courses ever co-designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and Jr., Winchester Country Club unfolds across 223 forested acres in the Sierra Nevada foothills above Sacramento. Perched at 1,800 feet \u2014 below the snow and above the fog \u2014 this private club offers panoramic views of both the Sierra peaks and the Sacramento Valley. The course plays through three distinct topographies: steep woodlands, rolling prairies, and dramatic granite outcroppings. Massive rock formations border fairways, streams and lakes wind through the layout, and towering pines frame every shot. Ranked #1 in Sacramento Valley and among California's top 15 by Golf Digest. The 35,000 sq ft European hunting lodge-style clubhouse won Golf Inc.'s Clubhouse of the Year 2005.",

    {
      "question": "Can groups play Winchester on a Reno/Tahoe golf trip?",
      "answer": "Yes \u2014 Winchester is the ideal first or last stop for groups traveling I-80 between Sacramento and Reno-Tahoe. We coordinate tee times, logistics, and pairing with your full trip itinerary. Contact us for private club access and group rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Winchester different from the Reno-Tahoe courses?",
      "answer": "Winchester sits in the Sierra foothills at 1,800 feet \u2014 warmer and drier than the Tahoe courses, with longer playing seasons. The RTJ Sr. & Jr. co-design is one of only seven such collaborations ever, and the 35,000 sq ft European hunting lodge-style clubhouse won Golf Inc.'s Clubhouse of the Year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Winchester a private club? How do groups get access?",
      "answer": "Winchester is a private club, but Golf the High Sierra can arrange group access for visiting golf groups as part of a multi-course trip package. Call us at 888-584-8232 for availability and private club booking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best time of year to play Winchester Country Club?",
      "answer": "Winchester plays year-round at 1,800 feet elevation \u2014 warmer and drier than Tahoe. Peak season is April through October. Spring and fall offer the best conditions with cooler temperatures and uncrowded tee sheets. Summer weekends book fast, so reserve 30+ days out for Saturday tee times."
    },
    {
      "question": "How difficult is Winchester Country Club?",
      "answer": "Winchester is a challenging championship layout with a slope rating of 145 from the Gold tees \u2014 among the highest in the region. Eight tee options from 5,289 to 7,144 yards make it accessible for all skill levels. The RTJ Sr. & Jr. design rewards shot-making with generous fairways but demands precision on approach shots to fast, contoured greens."
