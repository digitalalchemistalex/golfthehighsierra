The entire course is surrounded by some of the most beautiful homes in the region, it's picturesque from every angle. The front 9 has plenty of water and distance to challenge every golfer, and the back nine incorporates some challenging elevation change and has several holes up in the pines. Originally built as a private country club, the facility spared no expense in providing comfort, and the restaurant is renown across the region as having a great menu. The course is located half way between Reno and Carson City, and with the new Freeway exchange, you can make it there in 20 minutes from South Reno.",
