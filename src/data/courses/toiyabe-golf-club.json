  "pointOfView": "This Robert Muir Graves design is old school good. Set at the base of the mountains, directly below Lake Tahoe, you'll get diversity on every hole. The entire course is surrounded by some of the most beautiful homes in the region, it's picturesque from every angle. The front 9 has plenty of water and distance to challenge every golfer, and the back nine incorporates some challenging elevation change and has several holes up in the pines. Originally built as a private country club, the facility spared no expense in providing comfort, and the restaurant is renown across the region as having a great menu. The course is located half way between Reno and Carson City, and with the new Freeway exchange, you can make it there in 20 minutes from South Reno.",
