  "description": "While looking up you may catch a glimpse of a hawk or golden eagle, at eye level you may see deer or a coyote but facing down our fairways you will surely take note of the 62 white sand bunkers and 7 lakes. This private country club has quickly become a jewel of Reno and is available for groups after 12pm if booked through Golf the High Sierra. Named one of Golfweek\u2019s top private residential courses, Somersett Country Club has found its distinction as a secret, must-play that should be included on any Reno/Tahoe golf trip itinerary.",

  "pointOfView": "This private club is typically inaccessible to public play, but Golf the High Sierra is able to book groups of all sizes due to its relationship with the club, typically after 10am any day of the week. And you should take advantage of it! Somersett is a true championship golf course, with the level of difficulty being left up to you. Five sets of tee boxes and two combo tee layouts offer you the challenge you're after. Large, multi-tiered greens will create two-putt aspirations, but green trueness is always reliable with their exquisite course maintenance standards. The new clubhouse is the perfect venue for a post-round libation or group lunch or dinner.",
