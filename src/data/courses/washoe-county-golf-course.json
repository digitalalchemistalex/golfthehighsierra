  "pointOfView": "The Shoe has an absolutely throwback, old school quality to it that is hard to find in golf courses built after the 1970s. The course shows it age, but in the best way! Most of the course is flat, wide open and offers the opportunity to hit drivers on most holes, and take big cuts at them. But small greens, most distinctly remnants from it early designs, make approach shot accuracy and proper club selection paramount for scoring low. The ancient age and giant sizes of the course's elm, cottonwood, oak, and evergreen trees are impressive and in play continuously throughout your round.",

In the decades since, \"The Shoe\" has undergone many changes. But, to this day, it has held its own as one of the most beautiful, playable tracks in the Truckee Meadows, and remains a favorite for its club members, locals and visitors alike."
