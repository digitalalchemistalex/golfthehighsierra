  "description": "The Dick Bailey-designed course is sculpted into the natural surrounds in a masterful way. Each hole routes through gentle topography of rolling hills, with well-placed sand bunkers and subtle sloping greens making no shot a \"stroll through the pines\". But golf is just one of the splendors to enjoy while experiencing all Whitehawk Ranch Golf Club has to offer.",

  "pointOfView": "Whitehawk Ranch is an absolute gem built within the farmlands and rolling hills of the Mohawk Valley. A combination of meadows, gentle topographic relief, and massive pine trees set the perfect stage for Dick Bailey's design talents. Bailey accentuated the natural beauty of the landscape by designing 12 holes within the meadows and 6 within the adjacent forested hillsides. Numerous lakes and Sulphur Creek, as well as immense plots of native flowers and grasses, play a big part in your experience, and your scoring. With some narrow fairways that penalize errant tee shots tightening your grip, straighter players will find birdie chances in numbers on their well conditioned, receptive and true-to-roll greens. Boasting four reachable par 5s and a drivable par 4, risk can breed reward; execute properly however, as mishits are penalized greatly when hit into the deep grasses lining the fairways and forest floors. The beauty of Whitehawk Ranch is beyond compare! The towering Lakes Basin mountain tops to the west and blocky peaks to the north and east make you feel in a world unto your own. The snack bar is well known for its delicious quickly prepped grinders, and a full bar and an ample beer selection satisfies the toughest thirsts. Pair Whitehawk Ranch with Grizzly Ranch and a stay at Plumas Pines Golf Resort and you're in for a memorable group outing!",
