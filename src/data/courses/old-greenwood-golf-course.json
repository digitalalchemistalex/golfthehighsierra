  "pointOfView": "There are few courses that leave a marked memory like Old Greenwood does! Jack Nicklaus outdid himself with this design. Cut through massive Ponderosa Pines over rolling terrain, the layout could not be more challenging, but equally satisfying. The course is big and beautiful and demands the absolute best of your game in all phases to score low. The greens are fair sized, but multiple tiers, speedy conditions, and subtle breaks will have you relieved with a two-putt par. Entry points to most greens are narrow, and steep-faced bunkers do their job in penalizing a mis-clubbed approach. Nonetheless, regardless of score, you will be genuinely satisfied, if not giddy, by the beauty, impeccably manicured grounds, and all-around majesty of this jewel! Once will not be enough as you'll surely add Old Greenwood to your annual golf adventure in the Sierras, especially when paired with its sister course, Gray's Crossing. There are no better 36 holes in Northern California!",
