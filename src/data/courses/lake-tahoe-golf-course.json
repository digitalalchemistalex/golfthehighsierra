    "Since 1959, Lake Tahoe Golf Course has been the South Shore's go-to round — a William Bell Jr. design that plays through grassy mountain meadows with the Upper Truckee River creating natural water hazards and the Sierra Nevada providing a jaw-dropping 360-degree backdrop. As an Audubon-certified facility, the course preserves natural habitats for hawks, eagles, black bears, and beavers that golfers regularly encounter during their rounds. The park-style layout features tree-lined fairways, gentle streams, and strategic ponds that reward thoughtful shot-making over raw power."
