  "description": "The Northstar California\u2122 Resort golf course is an 18-hole, par-72 (men and women) course that makes every guest feel welcome. From beautiful scenic views to two unique nines, Northstar\u2122 Resort\u2019s pro-rated golf course maintains a comfortable feeling that will challenge golfers\u2019 skills and appeal to their senses. The 18-hole golf course was designed by Robert Muir Graves, legendary landscape architect. His designs are notorious for integrating rugged, wooded sites with wavy bunkers and putting surfaces. The result of a Graves creation is a very active looking course. His unique features create a flow of movement in the land, qualities golfers will experience while playing at Northstar Resort. The course plays up to 6,820 yards. Our course offers 5 tee locations and carries a rating of 73. Northstar Resort offers helpful pin placement sheets and a guide to every hole on the scorecard. It\u2019s the perfect spot for a group outing with the meadow nine being very playable and the mountain nine (back nine) yielding a challenge for all levels.",
