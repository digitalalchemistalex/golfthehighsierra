  "description": "Three-Time U.S. Open Champion Hale Irwin was instrumental in bringing soul and purpose to his Signature Design Hills Course. This 7,106- yard golf course is known for its small greens, dramatic elevation changes and deep bunkers. The undulating fairways, surrounding mountains, big sky views, and natural wildlife create breathtaking panoramic views of the entire Spanish Springs Valley. Incorporating aspects of what was once a working ranch and adding crystal clear lakes for an additional challenge, Hale created a course that brings every club out of the bag and into play. A true experience you can’t get at other golf resorts in Reno NV.",

The facility is perfectly suited for the hardiest of souls determined to play 36 holes in a day, especially groups playing a Ryder Cup or team-vs-team, multi-day format. The distinctly different courses, Lakes and Hills, offer experiences that couldn't be more different. The casual golfer interested in a single daily round, will find it just as accommodating, but be sure to play them both on separate days if your itinerary allows. David's Grill is well known by local residents for its superb food and cocktails, and great course maintenance and service standards promise great lies, smooth greens, and tidy surrounds. It's eastern valley location makes it more suited for year-round play.",

    "Enjoy your day amid natural lakes, murmuring springs, and mature cotton wood trees on this Robert Trent Jones Jr. designed course. The 7,410-yard course offers a multitude of dramatic scenes as the natural desert landscape flows in and around the green expanse of the course. This Reno NV golf course puts the perfect amount of water, sand, and grass together to give you an experience you won’t soon forget.",
    "Flatter terrain of the Lakes Course makes for a straight-forward distance evaluation and simpler and more accurate club selection. Once in the meadow, away from the holes adjacent to homes, the waterfowl and variety of bird species are unbelievable. They add a pleasant distraction to your round. Grab a “Back Nine Burger” off David’s Grill menu at the turn. The bacon jam is unreal!",
