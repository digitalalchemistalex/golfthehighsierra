  "pointOfView": "It's quite an achievement to be recognized by Golf Digest as a Top 100 Greatest Public Course in the US, but once you play Grizzly Ranch, you'll know why it's been recognized as such. It's big, beautiful, and as natural as can be! The design weaves up and down through undulating topography with holes laid out to compliment it, not disfigure it. Fescue grasses rise thickly beyond the secondary cuts of rough, with Mule's Ear and forest debris creating impenetrable thicket from which a successful recovery shot is as much luck as it is skill to execute. You'll need to let the big dog eat here though if you want to score low, as length is a major advantage. Two drivable par 4s can help make that dream a reality, however, and the all-grass practice range will help you to dial in the day's swing. Take time to calculate yardages as some tee shots can find hazards unseen from tee boxes and fairways, particularly hole no. 3's second shot, and tee shots on holes 12 and 17. You'll find Grizzly Ranch in impeccable shape with fairways cut tight and greens rolling smooth and quick. The Lake House is not to be missed for post-round reflection or an at-the-turn beer and bite. The overall development has been built to be one with nature and it achieves that with minimally invasive structural designs and color schemes. Grizzly Ranch should not be missed on any golf trip to the High Sierra, but make it all it can be with a paired round at Whitehawk Ranch or Plumas Pines, and a stay at Plumas Pines Golf Resort. You won't be sorry!",
