  "description": "Built on the former Fort Ord military base, Bayonet & Black Horse is a 36-hole complex steeped in military history with panoramic Monterey Bay views. Bayonet \u2014 designed by a left-handed Army general to fit his chronic fade \u2014 is legendary for 'Combat Corner,' the toughest stretch of holes on the peninsula. Black Horse offers a gentler ride with equally stunning ocean vistas.",

      "question": "Are both courses open to the public?",
      "answer": "Yes. Both Bayonet and Black Horse are fully public courses managed by Troon Golf, with green fees significantly lower than other Monterey Peninsula courses."

    {
      "question": "Which course should I play \u2014 Bayonet or Black Horse?",
      "answer": "Bayonet is the more famous and demanding layout, ranked among the toughest in California (slope 141). Black Horse is slightly more forgiving with better ocean views. Most GTHS groups play both over two days."

    {
      "question": "What is Combat Corner?",
      "answer": "Holes 11-15 on Bayonet \u2014 a series of sharp doglegs designed by the left-handed General McClure to match his slice. Jack Nicklaus called Bayonet the hardest course on the Monterey Peninsula."

    "Where the military once trained, golfers now test their mettle against two of the Monterey Peninsula's best public courses. Bayonet was built in 1954 by General Robert McClure, a lefty with a severe slice who designed every hole to match his game \u2014 creating the infamous 'Combat Corner' doglegs that still terrify players today. Black Horse arrived in 1964 and got a $13 million Gene Bates renovation that elevated it into a true championship layout. Both courses weave through mature cypress and oak trees with stunning panoramas of Monterey Bay."
