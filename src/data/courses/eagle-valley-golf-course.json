  "pointOfView": "Great on the budget, and located a short 30 minutes from Reno, this facility has plenty to offer in two very distinct courses. This facility is one of the few in the area with 36 holes on the same property, and for this reason is a great choice to get in two rounds on the same day. We suggest starting with the East Course with its more traditional layout and fewer challenges. The West Course flashes a lot of personality with several holes up in the foothills, dog legs, canyons to carry and can be a good challenge for most golfers. Wedge this course into the middle of 3 or 4 days of golf and the price will help get your budget where you need it to be.",
