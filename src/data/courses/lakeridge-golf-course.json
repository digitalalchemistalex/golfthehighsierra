  "description": "Lakeridge Golf Course is truly Reno’s Must See; Must Play Golf Course. Number 15, a par 3, features a tee shot from a hillside tee box 140 feet above the water to a true island! From the championship tee, this shot is 239 yards but plays about 195 yards to the middle of the green without wind. In windy conditions care must be taken at both the tee and the green. Lower and closer tees also are available without sacrificing the outstanding view of the city.",
