  "pointOfView": "T here is a good reason why Dayton Valley has played host to the first stage of qualifying for the PGA Tour since 1995. Its links style offers plenty of challenge that even the pros struggle to negotiate. Water is a primary feature and an unwelcomed hazard on nearly half the holes of this Arnold Palmer-designed, high desert masterpiece. The undulations on the course's big greens make successful execution of the flat stick a primary task of the day. The wind can be a friend or foe on many days as it can shorten the lengthy, downwind par 5s, yet wreak havoc on the short par 3s across or into the wind. Although Dayton is a bit of a drive from the Reno hotels and casinos, it's worth the effort to get there. It's very well manicured and the surrounding views will surely impress.",
