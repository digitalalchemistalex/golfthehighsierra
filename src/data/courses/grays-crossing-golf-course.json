  "pointOfView": "An air of over-confidence has turned to intrepidation for many teeing off the 1st hole at Gray's Crossing. At first glance, it appears to be straight-forward, with wide fairways and large greens begging for hefty swings and fearlessly lashed at approach shots. You'll quickly understand why caution will win the day, however. Yes, the greens are big and generous access points reward accuracy, but you'll find that there are secrets to be known to make for a low round. Many greens are spined with unforgiving fall-aways over the back, and sloped landing zones off the tee can turn an apparent beauty into a sagebrush-laden nightmare of a recovery shot. Many tee shots are smartly played with less than driver, as landing zone runouts will find native areas unseen from tee boxes. Without doubt though, there are numerous opportunities for sub-par scores if played with caution. A reachable Par 4 on each side offers solace to the other beautiful, longer holes throughout the course. All Par 5s are reachable and are birdie opportunities, less hole 18, which takes two monster shots to clear the native beranka. In any case of success or struggle, you'll enjoy every minute of your round at Gray's Crossing, especially as you reflect on it while sipping a frosty draft on the deck at PJs, Gray's Crossing's lovely bar restaurant that overlooks the 18th hole and Mt. Rose beyond.",
