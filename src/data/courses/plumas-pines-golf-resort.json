  "pointOfView": "Plumas Pines is the focal point for any golf trip to the Graeagle area! Surrounded by massive pine trees, the beautiful Feather River to the north, and bordering vacation homes and condominiums through much of the course, Plumas Pines will test your nerves from start to finish. The course is beautiful and always extremely well maintained. The greens are generally small enough to make you nervous, but also extremely receptive to most approach shots to ease your fear. No matter the hole, giant pine trees and wispy cottonwoods will make for a puckered tee shot. Length is absolutely not a necessity at Plumas Pines, in fact it might just be discouraged. Straight play is best and you're better off getting a ball safely in play with an iron off the tee than trying to recover from a shortened drive after it rattles through the forest. The natural beauty that surrounds Plumas Pines is lovely, with waterfowl and forest critters abundant. It's great to play at any time of day, but an afternoon tee time will make for a tranquil experience amongst long shadows and late day sun beams piercing through the pines. Plumas Pines Golf Resort has numerous condominiums and stand-alone vacation homes that can accommodate groups of any size. With Grizzly Ranch and Whitehawk Ranch mere minutes away, a multi-day outing with your buddies is properly hubbed here. While here, do not miss a meal at Longboards or Gumba's; two highly regarded restaurants by locals and visitors alike. And under no circumstances should you miss a visit to The Mohawk Tavern, Graeagle's perfectly seedy dive bar that will surely make for some unforgettable moments, or moments you'd rather forget!",

    "The par-4 393 yard 2nd hole with the Middle Fork of the Feather River meandering down the left side of the fairway and green, the tall pine trees guarding the right hand side of the fairway and the back of the green, and the smartly placed bunker in the front left hand side of the green represents all the wonderful elements that Plumas Pines Golf Resort has to offer. Accurately place your tee shot down the right center of the fairway leaving you a mid to short iron into this long and narrow green. Once on the green prepare yourself for subtle undulations and breaks that will test your putter throughout the round."
