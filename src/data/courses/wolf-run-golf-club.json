  "pointOfView": "No other Reno area golf course offers such a challenge, with rewarding beauty and serenity no matter how you score. You'll get lost in the views of the surrounding mountain tops and eastward across the Washoe Valley. Meandering streams and elevation changes make for some nervous shot-making, but forced carries are few from forward tee boxes if distance is not a strength of your game. There is always a ready beverage cart and a full-service bar and restaurant to help elevate your joy as well.",
