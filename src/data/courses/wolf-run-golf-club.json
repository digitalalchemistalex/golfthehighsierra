You'll get lost in the views of the surrounding mountain tops and eastward across the Washoe Valley. Meandering streams and elevation changes make for some nervous shot-making, but forced carries are few from forward tee boxes if distance is not a strength of your game. There is always a ready beverage cart and a full-service bar and restaurant to help elevate your joy as well.",
