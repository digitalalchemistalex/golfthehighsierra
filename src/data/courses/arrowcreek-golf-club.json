  "pointOfView": "Both the courses at The Club at Arrowcreek are great, but we like to play The Challenge Course a little bit more. It's routed at a slightly higher elevation than the Legend Course, making the views absolutely spectacular! The Challenge Course plays more in front of you, whereas a number of blind landing areas on the Legend Course can make shot lines unclear and daunting, especially off of the tee.",
