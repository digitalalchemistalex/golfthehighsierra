Trees and streams come into play throughout and it's our opinion that you'll leave thinking wow, why have I not played this before. This course offers a great price value for mountain golf and couldn't be more central to a full 3 or 4 day outing in Graeagle. Located right in the middle of town, it's easy to get to and only about an hour from Reno.",
