  "description": "Pignic Pub & Patio is a beloved community gathering spot in Reno, built inside a historic 1916 craftsman home at 235 Flint St. The concept is unique: a community grill yard with charcoal grills, gas grills, and smokers where guests bring their own proteins to cook (or purchase locally sourced cuts on-site), paired with 28 craft beers on draft and creative cocktails. The outdoor space includes a fire pit, edible garden, and sun deck, while the cozy interior serves as a sports parlor with multiple TVs. The Revision Brewing Taproom occupies the second floor. Dog-friendly and family-friendly, with live music most weekends.",
