  "description": "Tucked into a corner of the Eldorado's second floor across from The Brew Brothers, Hidden Pizza is a New York-style eatery serving pizza by the pie on weekends. Executive Chef Ivano Centemeri created a perfectly crafted pizza dough recipe for the lightly-sauced, wood-fired comfort food. The restaurant evokes old school New York pizzerias with two state-of-the-art ovens, an open-face letter board, bar-top seating with USB charging, and historic photos of old Reno.",
