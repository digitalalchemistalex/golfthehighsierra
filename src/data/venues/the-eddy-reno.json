The outdoor space includes Burning Man art installations, free yard games like giant Jenga, bocce courts, and cornhole, plus fire pits and hammock seating. Food comes from rotating food trucks and a wood-fired pizza oven. Open seasonally from March through late November, The Eddy is family-friendly during the day and dog-friendly, with live music and community events throughout the season.",
